# Turbocharger
Turbocharger started as a Google Code Project and is in the process of being migrated to GitHub.
Farewell old friend.

The Turbocharger Arduino motor driver is a motor driver designed to amplify the abilities for Arduino robot control. This driver board includes encoder counters, an on-board motor driver, and serial communication headers to be as adaptable as possible for projects needing small motors with encoders.
